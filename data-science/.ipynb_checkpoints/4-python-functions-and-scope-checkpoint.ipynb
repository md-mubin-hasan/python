    "This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "\n",
    "With this, we complete our discussion of functions in Python. We've covered the following topics in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating and using functions\n",
    "* Functions with one or more arguments\n",
    "* Local variables and scope\n",
    "* Returning values using `return`\n",
    "* Using default arguments to make a function flexible\n",
    "* Using named arguments while invoking a function\n",
    "* Importing modules and using library functions\n",
    "* Reusing and improving functions to handle new use cases\n",
    "* Handling exceptions with `try`-`except`\n",
    "* Documenting functions using docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial on functions in Python is by no means exhaustive. Here are a few more topics to learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions with an arbitrary number of arguments using (`*args` and `**kwargs`)\n",
    "* Defining functions inside functions (and closures)\n",
    "* A function that invokes itself (recursion)\n",
    "* Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return other functions\n",
    "* Functions that enhance other functions (decorators)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some resources to learn about more functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python Tutorial at W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/\n",
