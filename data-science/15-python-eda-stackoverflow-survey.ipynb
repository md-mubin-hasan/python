    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "- Download the CSV manually and upload it via Jupyter's GUI\n",

    "\n",
    "- Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust and TypeScript are the most \"loved\" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.\n"
